Process:

- Expressions
	Conditions always return constants via utility functions.
	Branch true/Branch false only on R1 ?
	Current does not work. 
- Actually run test code with some sort of assertion ? Add assert (r1 = 0) and break
- Assignment 
- Command groups
- Conditions
- Procedure invocation
- Procedure definition
- Variable definition
- Optimising. Short load ?
