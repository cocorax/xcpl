Process:

- import raw binary data as a label (so testfile.bin is imported as variables testfile.data.addr and testfile.data.size)

Build
- Import code in as pre-assembled relocatable code that can be mashed together to make a library.


Look at optimising (later after some code !) x!4 to a single "load word x and add 4 instruction" 
(e.g. generates a word reference) ?
