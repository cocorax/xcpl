Process:

- Write conditional routines for >= > <= < (== and <> use sub/xor)
- Normalise R1 routine (non-zero to -1/0)
- Expressions
- Actually run test code with some sort of assertion ? Add assert (r1 = 0) and break
- Assignment 
- Command groups
- Conditions
- Procedure invocation
- Procedure definition
- Variable definition
- Optimising. Short load ?
