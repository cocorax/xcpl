Process:

- Implement RANDOM ABS SIGN
- Document strlen, random, Abs, Sign

Build
- Project file (list of files, type defines action)
- Import source files
- Import code in as pre-assembled relocatable code that can be mashed together to make a library.


Look at optimising (later after some code !) x!4 to a single "load word x and add 4 instruction" 
(e.g. generates a word reference) ?
